## Common Types of Errors

1. Syntax Errors: Violations of Python syntax rules leading to issues on specific lines.

2. Indentation Errors: Incorrect indentation disrupting code block structure.

3. NameErrors: Referencing undefined names or variables.

4. TypeErrors: Performing operations on incompatible data types.

5. IndexErrors: Accessing lists or sequences with invalid indices.

6. KeyErrors: Trying to access non-existent keys in dictionaries.

7. ValueErrors: Passing inappropriate values to functions.

8. AssertionErrors: `assert` statements failing due to programming errors.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Interpreter:** Program executing other programs; Python programs require it.
- **Python Shell:** Interactive interpreter accessible from command line.
- **Data Type:** Specific data categories determining valid operations.
- **Exception:** Anticipatable error handled to prevent program crash.
- **Code Block:** Group of indented code lines forming a unit.
- **Function:** Named code block performing actions when called.

## Interpreting Error Messages

1. **Error Type:** Identifies error type (e.g., SyntaxError, NameError).
2. **Error Message:** Briefly describes the issue.
3. **Line Number:** Shows error detection line.
4. **Context:** Displays surrounding code snippet.

## Practical Examples

Explore real-world error scenarios and their interpretation using practical examples.

## Tips for Debugging

1. **Read Carefully:** Examine error messages thoroughly.
2. **Check Line Numbers:** Focus on indicated line numbers.
3. **Review Context:** Study context around the error line.
4. **Google It:** Search for solutions online.
5. **Use Print Statements:** Track variable values and flow.
6. **Isolate Code:** Test problematic code separately.
